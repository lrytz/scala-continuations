# scala-continuations [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scala/scala-continuations.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scala/scala-continuations)

scala-continuations is a library and a compiler plugin for Scala language that provides support for CPS transformations.

You may also be interested in https://github.com/scala/scala-async, which covers what was once the most common use case for the continuations plugin.

## Maintenance

This library is community-maintained.

There is not currently a lead maintainer. If you would like to volunteer, please open an issue and say so.

(In the absence of a volunteer maintainer, the Scala team at Lightbend is doing the barest minimum maintenance.)

## Scala versions supported

The current development branch supports Scala 2.11 and 2.12 on JDK 8+.  (Older artifacts, supporting older Scala versions, remain available on Maven Central.)

The [support for Scala 2.13](https://github.com/scala/scala-continuations/issues/37) is work in progress.
